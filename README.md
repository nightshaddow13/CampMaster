# CampMaster
The Camp-Master application is a platform for participating facilities to manage camp maps and event information.  Guests (Campers) can use the app to navigate the facility, receive notifications about upcoming events and activities, and even sign up for voluntary activities such as flag ceremonies and service projects.
